    	<p style="text-align: center;">“I was so impressed with my breakfast this morning! I tried the Fried Green Tomato Benedict and my boyfriend got the Crab Cakes Benedict. We both finished our whole plates and were so impressed with the quality of the food and the short amount of time it took to receive it. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. <br>I will definitely be back!”</p>

Potato pancakes were good. Will try the hash next time. Biscuits were great also.We enjoyed the Eggs Benedict served on homemade focaccia bread and hot coffee. <br>Perfect  service”</p>

Maddy, our server, was super attentive, on top of it and funny. She made the experience perfect. She brought out the food all at the same time and brought us anything we asked for. Would definitely come back to this place!”</p>

    			<p style="text-align: center;">“Amazing! A must! This casual dining restaurant has something for everyone! I had the mushroom risotto with scallops: the dish was to die for! It was a generous portion, served piping hot, creamy and with large scallops. Our wonderful server, Jess, brought us dinner rolls to eat while we waited for our meal. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, the rolls are doughy warm goodness; save room for dinner!”</p>
